  @sect{Enclosing tree [2873] does not include tree [2872]}
    Scalafix requires code to compile with the scalac option @code{-Yrangepos}.
    A macro that emits invalid tree positions is usually the cause of
    compiler errors triggered by @code{-Yrangepos}.
    Other tools like the presentation compiler (ENSIME) or
    Scalameta Semantic API also require @code{-Yrangepos} to work properly.

  @sect{sbt.Init$RuntimeUndefined: References to undefined settings at runtime.}
    You might be using an old version of sbt.
    sbt-scalafix requires sbt 0.13.13 or higher.
