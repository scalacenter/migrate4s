 * A linter message reporting a code style violation.

 * unique category of linting messages. For example, if you have an "unused
 * code" linter then you might want to create a <code>class UnusedCode extends
 * Diagnostic</code> class with the appropriate context.
 *
 * Expensive values such as the message and explanation can be computed
 * on-demand.
 *
 * @note
 *   for a Diagnostic that is associated with a specific rule use
 *   [[scalafix.lint.RuleDiagnostic]].
