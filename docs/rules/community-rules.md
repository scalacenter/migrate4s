## Hygiene rules

Hygiene rules enforce conventions, failing the build on violation or
rewriting the code when possible.

## Migration rules

Migration rules make it easier for library users to cope with
deprecations and breaking changes.

Official migrations provided by library authors are not
advertized here as they are usually well documented in the
project itself. Note that 
[Scala Steward](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward)
[keeps track of many of them](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward/blob/main/modules/core/src/main/resources/scalafix-migrations.conf),
to provide a seamless experience to library users opting-in
for the service.

## Code generation rules

Code generation rules extend the possibilities of the Scala language
by taking a route similar, yet parallel to macros.
