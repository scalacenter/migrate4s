There have been growing number of scalafix rules published by Scalafix users.

Users can leverage such published rules by following steps.

One method is to run rule dynamically with the following sbt command.

```sh
// sbt shell
> scalafix dependency:RULE@GROUP::ARTIFACT:VERSION
```

Each parts stands for the following.
* `RULE`: A name of rule to be performed.
* `@GROUP::ARTIFACT:VERSION`: An id to specify a dependency containing rules.

To permanently install the rule for a build, users can add the dependency to
`build.sbt` by updating `ThisBuild / scalafixDependencies`.

```scala
// build.sbt
ThisBuild / scalafixDependencies +=
  "GROUP" %% "ARTIFACT" % "VERSION"
// sbt shell
> scalafix RULE
```
